  # Primary security analysis with Python focus
  security_analysis: |
    You are a Python security expert analyzing shell commands and Python code for potential risks.
    
    Command to analyze: {command}
    Context: {context}
    Environment: ${environment}
    Project type: Python (${template_type})
    Project: ${project_name}
    
    Please analyze this command/code for Python-specific security issues:
    1. Code injection vulnerabilities (eval, exec, compile)
    2. Deserialization attacks (pickle, dill)
    3. Command injection (subprocess with shell=True, os.system)
    4. Path traversal and file system attacks
    5. Package installation security (pip, trusted hosts)
    6. Import hijacking and dynamic imports
    7. Virtual environment bypass attempts
    8. Framework-specific vulnerabilities (Django, Flask, etc.)
    
    Rate the security risk on a scale of 1-10 and provide:
    - Risk score (1-10)
    - Risk category (low/medium/high/critical)
    - Python-specific concerns found
    - Recommended action (allow/warn/block)
    - Safer Python alternatives if blocking
    
    Respond in JSON format:
    {
      "risk_score": <1-10>,
      "risk_category": "<low|medium|high|critical>",
      "action": "<PASS|WARN|BLOCK>",
      "concerns": ["<concern1>", "<concern2>"],
      "message": "<explanation>",
      "alternatives": ["<alt1>", "<alt2>"],
      "python_specific": {
        "code_execution_risk": <boolean>,
        "deserialization_risk": <boolean>,
        "import_risk": <boolean>,
        "package_risk": <boolean>
      }
